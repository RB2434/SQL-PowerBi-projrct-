## **Problem Statement**

The **Ola Data Analyst Project** aims to provide insights into ride management by analyzing customer ratings, booking statuses, cancellations, and order values. The dashboard helps identify areas where the company can improve customer satisfaction, reduce delays, and boost sales during peak times such as weekends and match days. With this project, the company can enhance its customer service, better manage resources, and reduce cancellations.

**Key Business Logic** includes:
- Orders cancelled by customers should be no more than 7%.
- Orders cancelled by drivers should be no more than 18%.
- Increase orders on weekends and match days.
- Keep incomplete rides under 6%.
